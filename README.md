# Universal Configurable AC Control Board

An open-source embedded control board designed to replace proprietary non-inverter AC PCBs and add WiFi-based configurability.

This project is intended for educational and experimental purposes only. Improper installation may cause electrical hazard.

## 📌 Project Overview

Many non-inverter air conditioners become unusable due to failed control boards, even though the compressor and cooling system remain functional. OEM replacement boards are often brand-specific and expensive.

This project proposes a modular, ESP32-based universal control board that enables:

- Compressor ON/OFF control
- Temperature setpoint configuration
- Local display feedback
- WiFi-based control interface
- Room size to AC tonnage recommendation tool

The goal is to promote repairability, sustainability, and open hardware experimentation.
